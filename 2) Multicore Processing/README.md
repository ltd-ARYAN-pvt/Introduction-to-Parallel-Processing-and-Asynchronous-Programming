# Multicore Processing in Python: A Simple Guide

## What is Multicore Processing?

Multicore processing allows programs to run on multiple CPU cores simultaneously. This is especially useful for CPU-bound tasks that require a lot of computation, like data processing, mathematical calculations, or machine learning.

Unlike multithreading (which is limited by Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock or GIL), multiprocessing runs separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter, which allows full utilization of multiple cores.

## Why Use Multicore Processing?

- **Parallelism**: Multicore processing allows for true parallel execution, speeding up CPU-intensive tasks.
- **No GIL Limitation**: Since each process has its own Python interpreter, it avoids the GIL, allowing multiple cores to run Python code in parallel.

### Key Libraries:
- `multiprocessing`: Provides tools for spawning multiple processes and managing shared data between them.
- `concurrent.futures`: A high-level interface that can also be used for multiprocessing via `ProcessPoolExecutor`.

## Using `multiprocessing` in Python

The `multiprocessing` library allows you to create and manage multiple processes. Each process runs independently, and they can run on different CPU cores.

### Example 1: Using `multiprocessing`

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def square_number(number):
    print(f"Square of {number} is {number * number}")
    time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = []
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Create a process for each number
    for number in numbers:
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=square_number, args=(number,))
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()

    # Wait for all processes to complete
    for process in processes:
        process.join()

    print("All processes have finished execution.")
```

### Explanation:
- `multiprocessing.Process`: Creates a new process.
- `.start()`: Starts the process.
- `.join()`: Waits for the process to complete before moving on.
- `if __name__ == "__main__"`: Ensures that the code block is only run in the main process (important for Windows systems).

In this example, each number is processed by a separate CPU core, and the squares are calculated in parallel.

## Using `concurrent.futures` for Multiprocessing

The `concurrent.futures` library can also be used for multiprocessing through `ProcessPoolExecutor`. This provides a simpler, high-level API for multicore processing.

### Example 2: Using `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
import time

def cube_number(number):
    print(f"Cube of {number} is {number * number * number}")
    time.sleep(1)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a ProcessPoolExecutor
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    executor.map(cube_number, numbers)

print("All tasks are completed.")
```

### Explanation:
- `ProcessPoolExecutor`: Manages a pool of worker processes that execute tasks concurrently.
- `.map()`: Distributes the function (`cube_number`) across the process pool for all the numbers in the list.

In this example, the `ProcessPoolExecutor` runs multiple processes concurrently, calculating the cube of each number in parallel.

## When to Use `multiprocessing` vs `concurrent.futures`?

- Use `multiprocessing` when you need more control over each process (e.g., starting, stopping, or managing multiple processes manually).
- Use `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` when you want a simpler, high-level interface for managing multiple CPU-bound tasks concurrently.

---

## Key Considerations:
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Since each process runs independently, sharing data between processes can be done via `multiprocessing.Queue` or `multiprocessing.Pipe`.
- **Use Cases**: Multicore processing is ideal for CPU-bound tasks like numerical computations, data analysis, and heavy processing jobs that require multiple CPU cores.

---

## Performance Considerations:
- **Overhead**: Starting new processes has more overhead than starting new threads, so multicore processing is best suited for long-running, CPU-bound tasks.
- **Shared Memory**: By default, each process has its own memory space, which means you need to use specific techniques like `multiprocessing.Manager` for shared data.
